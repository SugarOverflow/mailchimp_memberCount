#Mailchimp Member count
This is a quick python script that parses your Mailchimp API call (for a particular list) for the subscriber count and returns it.

##Base
Uses the [urllib2](https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib2.html) and [json](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html) python libraries.

##Deploy
```
python script.py
```

##Usage
With some clever tweaking you could probably return any parsed value you'd like from the API call
